# com.paalo.fmod-helper
Add this package to get easier functions for doing Fmod-related stuff through code.

# Requirements
This package **requires** that you already have the FMOD Unity Package installed in your project. Else you will get compilation errors, since the scripts in this package depend on the Fmod Integration.

Get the Fmod Unity Integration over at [FMOD's website](https://fmod.com/download).

# Adding the package to your project
Add the package to your project by adding this in your `manifest.json`-file, located in the `Packages`-folder of your Unity Project:
```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "com.paalo.fmod-helper": "https://github.com/PabloSorribes/com.paalo.fmod-helper.git",
    ...
  }
}
```
